    <p> Hello!
        <br>
        <br> For this assignment, I decided to draw inspiration from this beauiful piece by Josef Albers titled <a href="https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/219628">"Overlapping".</a> </p>
    <p> I decided to title my piece "Minimalism Infused Overlapping". When I looked at the piece by Josef Albers, I immediately fell in love with the montone color scheme and the overlapping of shapes and that's how I decided my image would take inspiration of the overlapping, in essence. </p>
    <p> My piece uses a blue monochromatic scheme and is an overlay of several primitive shapes including rectangles, lines, arc and quads. For the "live" element of the sketch, I decided to imitate a starry night background behind the image, when the mouse is pressed - go ahead and give that a try! To brighten up the sketch, I did not want to use shades of black and grey - hence I decided to go with shades of blue instead. </p>
    <p> In terms of technical difficulties, I have never been able to completely wrap my head around 'for loops' and I did want to take inspiration from the original piece and draw lines horizontally on the last box of the three boxes. After a lot of trial and error, I finally managed to get it right.
        <p> I had a lot of fun doing this assignment and I hope you enjoy looking at my perception of "art". </p>
